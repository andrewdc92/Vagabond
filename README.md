# Ã¼Travel

Check out our app on <a href="http://utravel.herokuapp.com/"> Heroku

## Objective
Our goal was to create a travel application built on relationships. The application allows users to sign up, login, and create posts that are attributed to different cities in the database. Each city has posts attributed to the cities. The posts describe different user experiences  related to the city. The cities have a one to many relationship with posts and the users have a one to many relationship with posts. We wanted to create a splash/landing page that displayed the name of the website, with a call to action and the necessary log in/sign up buttons. We knew that user authorization and authentication was necessary to recognize existing users, prevent faulty users, and to prevent the general public from editing/deleting content. We also wanted to create administrative privileges so that we can ban an email or delete any user's content if it's offensive or abusive.   

## Technologies Used
-Ruby on Rails
-Bootstrap
-Puma(default server)

The front end and back end is built on Ruby on Rails, with Puma running Ruby's default server. We used Bootstrap for the front end framework and so that we could work off a grid system. It also made the nav bar more aesthetically pleasing.


## User Stories <br>

## Control Flow

We made a new branch for each respective feature we built out. The idea of having a dev branch was difficult to stay in sync initially, but we ended up using scott-branch1 as our dev branch as a buffer between our feature branches and master. We had 35 branches total and over 100 commits. We had a few merge conflicts after the weekend that were tough to sort through but after that it was smooth sailing.
